The LSST Commissioning Camera (LSSTComCam) was mounted on the Simonyi Survey Telescope in August 2022 and observed for seven weeks in late 2024 until it was removed from the telescope in December 2024.
It is a smaller, fully functional version of `LSSTCam <https://lsstcam.lsst.io>`_, with only the central raft of 9 4k x 4k CCDs (all `ITL <https://www.itl.arizona.edu/capabilities>`_ sensors) and comprising 144 megapixels.
Every CCD has 16 amplifiers, each reading 1 million pixels.
LSSTComCam was designed to enable end-to-end testing of the observatoryâ€™s systems, including data acquisition, image processing, and observatory operations.
